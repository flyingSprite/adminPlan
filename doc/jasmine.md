## Jasmine function

`describe`: A test suite begins with a call to the global Jasmine function describe with two parameters: a string and a function. 
	
* The string is a name or title for a spec suite â€“ usually what is being tested.
* The function is a block of code that implements the suite.

`it`: Specs are defined by calling the global Jasmine function it, which, like describe takes a string and a function. The string is the title of the spec and the function is the spec, or test.
